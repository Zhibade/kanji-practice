# Kanji Drawing Practice Application - Python

Quick kanji drawing practice application. It picks a random
kanji from the "Source/data.json" file.

Clicking 次 on the lower left jumps to the next kanji.

Clicking 字 on the lower right displays the kanji in case you don't
remember how to draw it.

I'll try to keep the data updated.

NOTE: The included kanjis are being added by me as I learn them through
my personal studies/research.

Small personal project.
